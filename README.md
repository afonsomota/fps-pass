NOTE FOR THE REVIEWING PROCESS: the code is only meant to be publicly available with a published article, for that reason it is not uploaded yet.



## Running a simulation

In order to run a simulation import the Simulation class from Simulator.py module, instanciate the Simulation class and use the run method:

```
from Simulator import Simulation

sim = Simulation()
sim.run()
```
